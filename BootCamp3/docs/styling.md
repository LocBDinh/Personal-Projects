# Bootstrap 5 - Styling Templates

While we could create our web application with just HTML, CSS, and Javascript, writing all of our styles from scratch would be tedious.

Say we have an application that will be used by desktop, tablet, and mobile users alike. Our CSS would have to be responsive, changing the layout of the page depending on the user's device. Luckily, we have [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), a responsive HTML/CSS/JS framework made by Twitter, to style our web applications. Bootstrap provides a [grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/) for easy layout and many components that will give the application a clean, modern, and consistent look.

Bootstrap's documentation is extensive, so don't worry about memorizing everything Bootstrap has to offer. If you understand the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, you should feel comfortable with the mechanics of the grid system and using classes to add styles to your HTML components. It'll be a better use of time to just refer back to the documentation whenever you need to add a new component to your webpage.
