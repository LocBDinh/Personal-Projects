# Frontend Development Basics

Frontend web development revolves around anything you create that the users of that specific app sees. To put it plainly, it is everything to do with the User Interface (UI) of the app.

When developing the UI of your web application you will be using three major languages:

- [**HTML**](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) (HyperText Markup Language) is a [**markup language**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) most commonly used to create web pages. HTML is used to build the structure of your web page.
- [**CSS**](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to describe the presentation of our HTML pages. It is a styling markup language is used to format the appearance of different structural elements. 
- [**JavaScript:**](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) A programming language is used to describe the functionality and handle all the dynamic elements on the web page. 
- [**JSX**](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) - JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript used by React. JSX mixes HTML and JavaScript. It is similar to a template language, but it has full power of JavaScript.

If you aren't familiar with these technologies, please go through [this tutorial](http://learn.shayhowe.com) to learn the fundamentals of these two web technologies before continuing to the ***Bootstrap 5*** section. Keep in mind that this tutorial is very detailed and may take some time. Make sure to pay specific attention to:

- The semantic nature of HTML
- Layering CSS styles in a modular fashion using multiple classes
- The box model
- Positioning content with CSS

## Single-page Application

In this course and project we will be building, a single-page application. A single-page application is an application that loads a single HTML page and all the necessary assets (such as JavaScript and CSS) required for the application to run. Any interactions with the page or subsequent pages do not require a round trip to the server which means the page is not reloaded. Most modern web development relies on single-page applications.
