## Reflection

  - What was the context for this project?
  >This is a project built during my third year as a Computer Science student at the University of Florida. I was very tired of sifting through different planning applications and birthday trackers when it came down to planning that special day for my loved ones. My project goals included using the valuable skills I acquired in my Software Engineering class to build a Full-Stack Web Application to learn more and master those skills.
